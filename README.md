# YouTube-Video-Date-Organizer
Designed to collect data of a specified number of YouTube videos (can't just scour the entire website, as that will overload the YouTube Data API v3 quota) that include a keyword in their title (based on user input). Videos are organized by date published and represented visually via pyplot.

Note: This project was originally intended to track YouTube videos on "church". I was inspired by all the news headings regarding churches starting online services after the COVID-19 outbreak, so I really wanted to see how that affected YouTube as an entertainment/information platform. Of course, you can always replace the keyword to whatever suits your liking.
